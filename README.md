### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Savas. I enjoy writing software and learning languages & cultures.

As a software engineer I am fluent in C# and Javascript and have previous experience with Java and Dart. I worked with Windows Desktop applications in my early career as a software engineer, then moved to web with a little bit PHP and then ASP.NET MVC framework. I also developed some applications with Express, ReactJs and MongoDB. I created a few mobile applications for Android with Java and for cross-platform with Flutter framework. I have also experience with both RMDB and NoSQL databases systems, in particular SQL Server and MongoDB. I occasionally used BaaS tools like Firebase. Lately I have taken up Rust and feeling quite excited about it. By the way I love working, and I love working efficiently to be more precise.

Currently I am working mostly in the backend part of quite a complex project. I help enhancing the architecture and performance of a DCIM project (C# Services and REST API, Angular SPA). I create innovative and well-founded solutions in the form of libraries for emerging business requirements encompassing wide range of technical implementations; human & face detection and image processing, monitoring system resources, accessing and streaming IP camera devices over network to web and Android/iOS applications. I lead and maintain unit & integration testing of the projects and migrating to well-established CI/CD workflows.

If you are still interested to learn more about me, remember I mentioned about languages and cultures? Yeah, I am a language enthusiast. I studied many languages since my early adolescence including English (ofc), Spanish (my favorite), Arabic, Russian, French, Portuguese... I seldom read French to improve my level a little bit more. I actually have been trying to build an application for language learning but could not reach the end result just yet (unfortunately due to my intense perfectionist attitude and lack of time for that matter). Having been to more than 20 countries and to a lot more cities, (Spanish being my favorite), I have a passion for travel.

Finally, I write a lot in private but this is the first time I am writing about myself publicly (this is the first version of this markdown file). So, thanks for making it this far and do not hesitate to contact me for any collobration. I am always open to communication, reach me at ðŸ“«  savasusame@gmail.com or savasusame@protonmail.com.

I wish you a great day!
Savas.
